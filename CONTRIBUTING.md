# Contribution guidelines

I'm happy about any pull requests and bug reports. As this is a one man project at the moment it can take some time until bug reports or pull requests are answered.


## Coding Guidelines

* space after : but not before
* use comments to explain what you are doing

## Adding trains

As there are many different trains in the world it is not possible for me to provide all of them.

If you think a specific train is missing, feel free to add it to the list in /functions/train_details

You don't necessarily need to add a picture of the train, you can just use one of the default ones in /img/trains.

If you provide a picture, please be aware of the following guidelines for train pictures:

* view from the side
* scale: 1px ^= 10cm
* size: height: 50px, no whitespace on bottom and on sides
* format: preferably svg, other common formats are ok as well, no animations
* only upload pictures that are made by yourself or where you have the appropriate copyright.
